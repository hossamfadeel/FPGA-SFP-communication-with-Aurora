# FPGA-SFP-communication-with-Aurora
This project is based on Xilinx FPGA ZCU102.
The SFP connector and Xilinx IP Aurora is used in this project.
This design is aiming at test the communication of two SFP connector. Two Aurora Ip are instantiated in the design and data is looped back via a 10G SFP+ Passive Direct Attach Copper Twinax Cable.

The design can be found in the ./HW/block_diagram.pdf.
